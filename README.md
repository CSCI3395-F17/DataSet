# DataSet

### DATASET 1
[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names)

A dataset detailing the frequency of baby names at a state and national levels over a variet of years.

Questions

1. Is there any relationship to the trend of popular names?
2. Are there any popular names that stem popular name variants?
3. What are the most popular names for each year?

I find this dataset interesting because I would like to see how baby names change over years. Many current names evolve from popular older names, and it would be interesting to see if that could be determined visually through this particular dataset.

Looking back: 

1.To find relationships in a trend is pretty vague, likely I would do a graphX algortithm to find connections between edges and rank them.
2. This would also be pretty difficult since I would have to figure out a root of some sort to compare names with.
3. This is super easy and would only just be looking at the data essentially. 

### DATASET 2

A dataset detailing global terrorist attacks from 1970 through 2016. Includes information like the date, location, weapon, target, etc.

Questions

1. What countries have experiences the most terrorist attacks over the years? What region?
2. Is there a trend of the frequency of terrorist attacks over the years?
3. Is there a trend in the type of weapon used in terrorist attacks over the years?

I find this dataset interesting since terrorism has been an issue for centuries and has continued to be an issue up until today, dispite safety measures to try and reduce it. Nowadays, people constantly say that terrorism is a huge problem, but I would like to know how it compares to 10 years ago? 20 years ago? Has terrorism gone down? Or is it still a constant problem in other parts of the world?

Looking back:

1. This would be really easy by using agg()
2. This would be really easy by plotting 
3. This would also be really easy with plotting

### DATASET 3
[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/scientist-migrations)

A dataset detailing the migration of scientists. Includes information like origin location, when and where phD was obtained, and whether the individual has moved and when.

Questions

1. What is the frequency of scientists that move to a new country to obtain a phD?
2. What is the frequency of scientists that move after obtaining a phD?
3. What countries are experiencing an influx of scientists?

This dataset interests me since I intend to presue a phD and possibly move to another country. I think it would be interesting to see if there is any relationship between where scientists originate from, where they get their phDs, and where they then ultimately move to? Or to see if there is even a significant numbe of phD scientists moving to a new country.

Looking back:

1. This would be really easy using simple math
2. Same as Question 1
3. This can be done by grouping by countries and counting the number of science migratants.
